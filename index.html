<p>
e-daak, or maybe eDaak, or e-Daak. Something on the lines of electronic daak.
</p>

<p>
"daak" means post or mail in Hindi and Urdu. I am pretty sure it means the post or mail in many other languages and dialests of Indian subcontinent as well. "Daak" also means calling in Bangla (as in calling someone, or addressig in a way); e.g., someone's "daak naam" (calling name or nickname). A blog (as if that has ever happened), an email service (huh), or maybe just a newsletter. Who knows. Or maybe just nothing.
