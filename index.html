<p>
e-daak, or maybe eDaak, or e-Daak. Something on the lines of electronic daak.
</p>

<p>
"daak" means post or mail in Hindi and Urdu. I would assume it means the post or mail in many other languages and dialests of Indian subcontinent as well. "daak" also means calling in Bangla (as in calling someone, or addressig in a way); e.g., someone's "daak naam" (calling name or nickname). Shall I put up something on this website? Maybe a blog or something else, something on those lines. Or maybe just nothing. I reckon it'd be the letter. But who knows.
