        e-daak, or maybe eDaak, or e-Daak. Something on the lines of electronic
        daak.
    </p>

    <p>
        "daak" means post or mail in Hindi and Urdu. I would assume it means the
        post or mail in many other languages and dialects of the Indian
        subcontinent as well. "daak" also means calling in Bangla (as in calling
        someone, or addressing in a way); e.g., someone's "daak naam" (calling
        name or nickname).

    <p>
        Shall I put up something on this website? Maybe a blog or something
        else; something on those lines. Or maybe just nothing. I reckon it'd be
        the letter. But who knows.

        There is nothing for you to view here right now. Not yet. Not much,
        anyway.
