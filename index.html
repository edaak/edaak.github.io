<p>
e-daak or maybe eDaak or e-Daak. Something on the lines of electronic daak.
</p>

<p>
"daak" means post or mail in Hindi and Urdu and I am pretty sure in many other languages and dialests of Indian subcontinent. "Daak" means calling in Bangla, like someone's "daak naam" i.e calling name or nickname. A blog (as if that'll ever happen), an email service (huh), or maybe just a newsletter. Who knows. Or maybe just nothing.

There is nothing for you to view here right now. Not much, anyway.
